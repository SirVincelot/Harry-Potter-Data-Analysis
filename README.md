# Harry Potter Streamlit App

#### -- Project Status: Active

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to get an understanding of the characteristics of prople form the Harry Potter books. This is done by using a dataset from kaggle, and using streamlit for visualization. Eventually, the app will be deployed on streamlit, so everyone can see it given he knows the URL.

### Technologies
* Python
* Visualization using Plotly
* Interavtive App deployment using Streamlit
* Pandas, VS Code

## Project Description
The data came from Kaggle, to be more precise from this URL:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gulsahdemiryurek/harry-potter-dataset.
The questions I explore in my notebook are the following:
* presence of male and female characters within the book. As J.K.Rowling sees herself as a feminist, there should be at least some balance here
* The distribution of morally "good" vs "evil" characters from the house based on who they are following
* The gender, job, and blood status per house
* The question if the probability is higher to survive the book if the character is considered good
I want to visualize using plotly, and deploy the app via streamlit

## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*

3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages)
create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
